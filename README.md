# Homebridge Security Floodlights

This [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/) plugin is for linking your smart lights and motion sensors together to create a motion-controlled security floodlight setup.

## Prerequisites

* HomeKit lights.
* HomeKit sensors that will be used to trigger your lights.
* An app, like [Controller for HomeKit](https://controllerforhomekit.com/), that can build advanced automations.

## Features

* A _Wind Override_ switch for disabling the motion sensor automations if there's high wind that might falsely trigger your lights.
* One or more _Light Groups_ for controlling as many groups of floodlights/sensors as you wish.
* An _Override_ switch per _Light Group_ for disabling the motion sensor automations for that group of floodlights.
* A customizable motion delay, so your floodlights won't turn off until motion hasn't been detected for the customized amount of time.
